    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This simple brick-oven pizza recipe has been made famous by several well-known, Brooklyn wood-fire pizzerias.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Dough:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup cold water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Toppings:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ounces low moisture mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup no salt added canned crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>6 leaves fresh basil, torn</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, <br> 
            then sprinkle yeast over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes. <br>
            Stir in cold water and salt. <br>
            Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. <br>
            Coat with olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours. <br>
            Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise.
        </li>
        <li>Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C). <br>
            Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.</li>
        <li>Prepare the first pizza: <br>
            Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and stretch gradually until about 14 inches in diameter, <br>
            or about the size of the pizza stone. Place on the floured peel.
        </li>
        <li>Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, <br>
            then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon pepper over the top. <br>
            Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, <br>
            leaving some empty areas, then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over top.
        </li>
        <li>With a quick back and forth jerk, <br>
            make sure dough will release from the peel easily. <br>
            Place the tip of the peel at the back of the preheated pizza stone, <br>
            and remove the peel so that the pizza is left on the stone.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; <br>
            then slide off the peel onto a work surface. <br>
            Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves randomly over the pizza. <br>
            Cut into wedges and serve.
        </li>
        <li>Follow Steps 5 through 9 to make the second pizza.</li>
    </ol>
